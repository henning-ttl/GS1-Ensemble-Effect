# GS1-Ensemble-Effect
How the GS1 Ensemble works. (Mostly my theories)

Hello, I have been a big fan of the Yamaha GS1 Ensemble for a while, and after successfully emulating it
I decided to collect all the important stuff in one place. You can do whatever you want with the info here.
If you make a VST using it or an FX pedal then thats enough to make it worth writing this.

Hope it's an interesting read, enjoy!
